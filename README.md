# Clinical AI Learning Journey

This repository documents my structured learning path toward AI, machine learning, and clinical application development in healthcare.

Background:
- Medical Doctor
- Focus on AI integration, implementation, and clinical decision support
- Emphasis on correctness, interpretability, and real-world usability

## Learning Philosophy
- Clinical reasoning first, models second
- Simple, explainable code before complexity
- Healthcare-specific pitfalls (bias, leakage, validation) explicitly considered

## Structure
Each folder corresponds to a learning phase and includes:
- Executable code
- A README explaining objectives, concepts, and limitations

## Learning Roadmap (high-level)

- [x] Python environment & fundamentals
- [ ] Cohort-level logic & loops
- [ ] Data analysis (Pandas, visualization)
- [ ] Classical ML for clinical prediction
- [ ] Deep learning foundations
- [ ] Clinical AI prototyping & deployment

## Disclaimer
All code is for educational purposes only.  
Not intended for clinical use.
